# Siege-Account-Switcher
A simple Account Switcher for those with a Steam and Uplay version of Rainbow Six Siege

This is a simple script with the Steam and Uplay defaultargs.dll files included.

To use, all you need to do is follow the instructions here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/alx5ux/steam_and_uplay_versions_without_2_separate/

Skip steps 2-4 and 6. You don't need to do those anymore because of this! :D

Once done doing those steps, extract everything in this Zip file to your game's folder and run the script! It's that simple. 

If at any time you wish to switch between accounts, as long as you manually logged into your Uplay version's account, this will automatically copy the correct defaultargs.dll file to your game and you won't need to login at all!

Have fun with that extra space!
